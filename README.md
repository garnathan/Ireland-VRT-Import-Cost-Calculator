## Example Calculation

For a 2020 petrol car with 150g/km CO2, purchased for ¬£15,000:

### From United Kingdom:
```
UK Price: ¬£15,000
Exchange Rate: 1.17 (example)
Vehicle Value: ‚Ç¨17,550
Transport Costs: ‚Ç¨350
OMV: ‚Ç¨17,900

Customs Duty (10%): ‚Ç¨1,755
VRT Rate: 25% (150g/km CO2)
VRT Amount: ‚Ç¨4,475
VAT Base: ‚Ç¨17,550 + ‚Ç¨1,755 + ‚Ç¨4,475 = ‚Ç¨23,780
VAT (23%): ‚Ç¨5,469
Registration Fee: ‚Ç¨102

Total Import Cost: ‚Ç¨29,701
```

### From Northern Ireland:
```
UK Price: ¬£15,000
Exchange Rate: 1.17 (example)
Vehicle Value: ‚Ç¨17,550
Transport Costs: ‚Ç¨350
OMV: ‚Ç¨17,900

Customs Duty: ‚Ç¨0 (No duty - EU customs union)
VRT Rate: 25% (150g/km CO2)
VRT Amount: ‚Ç¨4,475
VAT Base: ‚Ç¨17,550 + ‚Ç¨0 + ‚Ç¨4,475 = ‚Ç¨22,025
VAT (23%): ‚Ç¨5,066
Registration Fee: ‚Ç¨102

Total Import Cost: ‚Ç¨27,193
```

**Savings from Northern Ireland: ‚Ç¨2,508** (8.4% less)

**Cost Breakdown (UK Import):**
- Vehicle + Transport: ‚Ç¨17,900 (60.3%)
- Customs Duty: ‚Ç¨1,755 (5.9%)
- VRT: ‚Ç¨4,475 (15.1%)
- VAT: ‚Ç¨5,469 (18.4%)
- Registration: ‚Ç¨102 (0.3%)
