## Example Calculation

For a 2020 petrol car with 150g/km CO2, purchased for ¬£15,000:

### From United Kingdom:
```
UK Price: ¬£15,000
Exchange Rate: 1.17
Vehicle Value: ‚Ç¨17,550
Transport Costs: ‚Ç¨350
OMV: ‚Ç¨17,900

Customs Duty (10%): ‚Ç¨1,755
VRT Rate: 20% (150g/km CO2)
VRT Amount: ‚Ç¨3,580
VAT Base: ‚Ç¨17,550 + ‚Ç¨1,755 + ‚Ç¨3,580 = ‚Ç¨22,885
VAT (21%): ‚Ç¨4,806
Registration Fee: ‚Ç¨102

Total Import Cost: ‚Ç¨28,143
```

### From Northern Ireland:
```
UK Price: ¬£15,000
Exchange Rate: 1.17
Vehicle Value: ‚Ç¨17,550
Transport Costs: ‚Ç¨350
OMV: ‚Ç¨17,900

Customs Duty: ‚Ç¨0 (No duty - EU customs union)
VRT Rate: 20% (150g/km CO2)
VRT Amount: ‚Ç¨3,580
VAT Base: ‚Ç¨17,550 + ‚Ç¨0 + ‚Ç¨3,580 = ‚Ç¨21,130
VAT (21%): ‚Ç¨4,437
Registration Fee: ‚Ç¨102

Total Import Cost: ‚Ç¨26,369
```

**Savings from Northern Ireland: ‚Ç¨1,774** (6.3% less)

**Cost Breakdown (UK Import):**
